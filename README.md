This is a capstone project developed to facilitate the using of CCTV or any video source.
The Saudi Arabian government launched Vision 2030, aiming to improve government efficiency, global engagement, and quality of life. The project aims to support local content and advance the use of surveillance cameras, which are crucial for ensuring security. Surveillance cameras are expensive and complex, but computer vision and AI can provide a more cost-effective and reliable solution. The project will demonstrate the implementation of the YOLOV8 tracking algorithm in conjunction with OpenCV and supervision libraries. The project includes features such as self-checkout, individuals, gender detection, gender-targeted advertising, control over specific areas, real-time object detection on webcam video streams, a sophisticated chatbot interface in Python, and stock-out notifications. The project aims to enhance digital interactions and provide prompt responses to user inquiries. The project will evaluate the performance of these methods on multiple datasets using measures such as accuracy
